</strong></div><div><strong>Our unique Cultural safaris will take you on an adventure of a lifetime, into the heart of the Tanzanian northern safari circuit. Nowhere else in Africa do we find the sheer numbers of animals, predators and carnivores like the African lion, or the ease with which these animals can be viewed, as in Tanzania.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Our 7 Day Cultural safari was designed for the traveller with an adventurous spirit, seeking an intimate experience in the local African Masai tribes, but also still taking advantage of enjoying a wildlife safari which includes visits to Lake Manyara and Serengeti National Parks, Lake Eyasi, and the famous Ngorongoro Crater which, featurs one of the highest concentrations of game in Africa. Here you will witness an amazing spectacle of African wildlife – inside a self-contained world teeming with animals. The tour will further take you to the Serengeti National Park, into the heart of wild Africa, a massive wilderness of 14500 square km, where everyday brings a new landscape and a new adventure. You will visit the Lake Manyara National Park, one of Tanzania’s most dramatically located wildlife areas, consisting of a shallow but huge soda lake, at the foot of the Great Rift Valley’s western escarpment. The tour also includes a visit to Lake Eyasi a salt lake situated between the Rift Valley’s Eyasi escarpment and the Kidero Mountains. The area around Lake Eyasi is inhabited by the Hadzabe bushmen, some of the last remaining hunter-gatherers on the African continent.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>This is a suggested or sample Tanzanian safari itinerary – it can be adapted to suite your own personal needs and preferences, or any seasonal changes and migratory animal movements. As with all our African safaris, we have offered you a wide variety of accommodation options – directly impacting on the total safari costs – in order to offer you the widest possible tour budget options. Please do not hesitate to contact one of our travel consultants directly, should you require any further assistance or more detailed info, regarding any of our Tanzanian safaris.

</strong></div><div><strong>ITINERARY FOR THIS TOUR
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 1- Arusha – Lake Manyara
</strong></div><div><strong>Distance: 130 km
</strong></div><div><strong>At around 08:30 we leave Arusha town and drive for two hours to Lake Manyara National Park.
</strong></div><div><strong>We arrive in time for lunch at the lodge and enjoy an afternoon game drive in the Lake Manyara National Park. Lake Manyara National Park is one of Tanzania’s most dramatically located wildlife areas, consisting of a massive but shallow soda lake (covering two-thirds of the park) at the foot of the Great Rift Valley’s western escarpment. The park’s varied habitat attracts a wide variety of African animals, including one of Africa’s largest concentrations of elephants, Manyara’s famous tree-climbing lions, as well as large flocks of flamingos, attracted by the algae in the lake.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 2 – Lake Manyara – Lake Eyasi
</strong></div><div><strong>Distance: 110 km
</strong></div><div><strong>After breakfast we will drive to the shores of Lake Eyasi. We arrive in time for lunch at the Tindiga Tented lodge.
</strong></div><div><strong>Lake Eyasi is a very scenic soda lake found on the southern border of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. This less visited lake lies at the base of the Eyasi escarpment on the western rift valley wall. This afternoon you will be introduced to the extraordinary people who belong to an indigenous tribe known as the ‘Hadzabe’ (hunter-gatherer bushmen). The tribe inhabits the shores of Lake Eyasi as do the Nilotic-speaking Datoga tribe. You will visit these tribes, which will include a visit to their homesteads, learn about their way of life, animal tracking, medicinal plants, and much more. Some wildlife and a wide range of bird species can be viewed during walks around the lake, which can be arranged.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Return for dinner and overnight at Tindiga Tented Lodge.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 3 – Lake Eyasi – Ngorongoro
</strong></div><div><strong>Distance: 150 km
</strong></div><div><strong>Early morning we depart to the village for local hunting experience with Hadzabe and Datonga tribes. This is not a mere performance. The bushmen rely on these techniques to survive and you’ll need to be very attentive and at times quiet, while they demonstrate their use of locally made poisons in incapacitating the poor creatures on which they depend for survival.
</strong></div><div><strong>We return to the Tindiga Tented Lodge for a late breakfast and we then travel to the Ngorongoro Conservation area.
</strong></div><div><strong>Late afternoon drive to a Masai Village. Visitors meet the village elders, get an insight into the Masai way of life, visit the bomas, learn about their prized cattle and visit the local school.

</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>

</strong></div><div><strong>Distance: 145 km
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>After breakfast at the lodge, we will descend over 600 meters into the crater to view wildlife for a half day’s tour. Supported by a year round water supply and fodder, the Ngorongoro Crater supports a vast variety of animals, which include herds of wildebeest, zebra, buffalo, eland, warthog, hippo, and giant African elephants. Another big draw card to this picturesque national park, is it’s dense population of predators, which include lions, hyenas, jackals, cheetahs and the ever-elusive leopard We will visit Lake Magadi, a large but shallow alkaline lake in the south western corner, which is one of the main features of the crater. A large number of flamingos, hippos and other water birds can usually been seen here.
</strong></div><div><strong>We return to the lodge to enjoy lunch and then we the head towards the Serengeti National Park with a stopover at Olduvai Gorge, boasting with history dating back to the dawn of time. It was here, that the anthropologists Drs. Lois and Mary Leakey discovered the skulls of the famous ‘Nutcracker Man” and ‘Handy Man’, both very significant links in the chain of human evolution. Leaving the highlands behind, we descend into the heart of wild Africa – the Serengeti National Park – with its endless plains, rolling into the distance as far as the eye can see. We do a late game drive en route to the lodge.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Enjoy dinner and overnight at the Serengeti Sopa Lodge.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 5 – Serengeti
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 5 will offer you an ideal opportunity to do an optional but unforgettable Hot Air Balloon flight, followed by a delightful champagne breakfast (available at a supplementary cost, but can be booked in advance). After breakfast we head to the south-eastern side of the park, visiting the Barafu Kopjes and the Ngare Nanyuki River area, for our morning and afternoon game drives.
