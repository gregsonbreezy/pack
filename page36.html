</strong></div><div><strong>Quick Itinerary Overview
</strong></div><div><strong>First we explore the diverse Tarangire National Park, home to one of Tanzania's largest elephant populations and considered one of the most beautiful game reserves in Tanzania. Next we take a scenic drive through the Great Rift Valley to Tanzania's most famous game reserve, Serengeti National Park, home to the annual Great Migration, the world's largest animal migration! From the game-rich plains of the vast Serengeti we make our way to Ngorongoro via Karatu, where we take a guided walk in the coffee plantations. Lastly we explore the Big Five Ngorongoro Crater, known as Africa's Garden of Eden, enjoying some rewarding game viewing.
</strong></div><div><strong>This Budget Tanzania Lodge Safari ends back in Arusha where our wildlife and scenic journey of a lifetime began.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>ITINERARY FOR THIS TOUR
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 1: Arusha to Tarangire National Park (Tanzania)
</strong></div><div><strong>This Budget Tanzania Lodge Safari starts with a short tour briefing in Arusha before we set off southwest towards our first Tanzanian game viewing destination, Tarangire National Park.
</strong></div><div><strong>This diverse game park is home to a large variety of wildlife and is considered one of the most beautiful wilderness areas in northern Tanzania. Tarangire Park hosts one of the largest elephant populations in Tanzania and is said to be one of the best places in East Africa to get up close to the giants. The game park is dotted with big baobab and acacia thorn trees, and is home to an impressive array of birds. This top Tanzanian game park is also home to various big cats including lions, leopards and cheetahs, as well as tree-climbing pythons. Other wildlife inhabiting the game park include many giraffes, buffalos, zebras and various antelope species such as gazelles.
</strong></div><div><strong>We spend the afternoon enjoying superb game viewing in Tarangire Park followed by our first overnight stay at a tented camp a short drive from Tarangire National Park.
</strong></div><div><strong>We stay in luxury, en-suite tents with verandas that look out over Lake Burunge and Tarangire beyond. Facilities at the safari camp include a pool, and main lounge and dining/bar area raised on a wooden deck so that guests can enjoy the views. Sit back and relax with sundowners as the sun sets over the lake and surrounding bush, or sidle up to the cosy fireplace on chill nights.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Meals: Lunch; Dinner
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 2: Tarangire National Park to Great Rift Valley (Tanzania)
</strong></div><div><strong>After breakfast on day two we leave the Tarangire National Park area, travelling north towards Lake Manyara National Park.
</strong></div><div><strong>We continue to our lodge on the edge of the Rift Valley overlooking Lake Manyara and the floor of the Great Rift Valley. Flanked by the fertile Ngorongoro Highlands accommodation is in comfortable tented rooms with en suite bathrooms and lodge facilities include a dining room and bar with a viewing deck.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Meals- Breakfast; Lunch; Dinner
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 3: Great Rift Valley to Serengeti National Park (Tanzania)
</strong></div><div><strong>On day three we leave the African Rift Valley travelling to the lush crater highlands. Reaching the highlands we are met by panoramic views over the Masai Plains and the Lake Manyara. Along the way we stop to take photographs and enjoy the scenic views.
</strong></div><div><strong>Next we drive via Karatu to the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, passing the crater highlands we witness the wide open plains of the southern part of Serengeti Park. Looking out over the rolling plains it is easy to see why the Maasai people call it “Siringitu” - the endless plain.
</strong></div><div><strong>The southern section of the Serengeti Plains truly appear to go on forever, stretching as far as the eye can see. The Kopjie (small rocky hill) dotted plains, offer an ideal hunting terrain for cheetahs and the other big cats of Africa.
</strong></div><div><strong>We stay at a tented camp located in the central area of Serengeti National Park, arriving in the afternoon. This evening we relax around the campfire at our mobile camp surrounded by the African bush.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Meals- Breakfast; Lunch; Dinner
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 4: Serengeti National Park (Tanzania)
</strong></div><div><strong>Day four is set aside for game viewing in the vast Serengeti National Park. The best vantage points and worthwhile areas are chosen to give you the best possible chance to observe the wild animals and to capture your perfect photo.
</strong></div><div><strong>Tanzania's most famous game park, the Serengeti Park is where the wildlife spectacle of the annual Great Migration takes place, the biggest animal migration in the world. Here vast herds of stampeding wildebeest, gazelle and zebra can be seen migrating across the plains in search of fresh grazing, in turn attracting numerous predators.
</strong></div><div><strong>Depending upon the time of year, you have the chance to witness the great migration as a hundred thousand wildebeests and zebras stampede across the plains. During the small rainy season in October and November, you will typically see these herds moving from the Kenyan Maasai Mara through the northwest Serengeti to the plains in the south.
</strong></div><div><strong>After the great rain season in April, May and June, the herds travel slowly back through the west and northwest Serengeti. With fluctuations in rainfall, the animals migrate during different times and along various routes. Your guide will know where and when to find the animals to ensure that you can see the animals from the best spot in the national park.
</strong></div><div><strong>Serengeti National Park offers spectacular game viewing year round, being home to healthy populations of Africa's Big Five - rhino, lion, buffalo, elephant and leopard as well as huge numbers of various antelope species such as eland, topi, kudu, impala, oribi, waterbuck and gazelle. Cheetah, hippo, giraffe, serval cat, crocodile, hyena and a rich array of other wildlife including numerous monkey, mongoose and rodent species also inhabit the Serengeti, along with over 500 bird species!
</strong></div><div><strong>You have the option of taking a guided trip to the visitor's centre with a representative of the Frankfurt Zoological Society. The knowledgeable guide can tell you about the work this organization has been involved in for the last thirty years in Serengeti (advise when booking). We enjoy some more rewarding game viewing in the afternoon, before returning to our tented camp in Serengeti for another night in the African wilderness.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Tonight you will stay at the same Serengeti Tented Camp as on day three.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Meals- Breakfast; Lunch; Dinner
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 5: Serengeti National Park to Karatu &amp; Coffee Plantations (Tanzania)
</strong></div><div><strong>On your outward journey to the Serengeti National Park Gate, you will have another chance to watch the beautiful wildlife of Africa.
</strong></div><div><strong>Leaving behind the wonderful Seronera Valley with its wildebeests and zebras as well as occasional visits by lions and other large cats such as cheetahs and leopards, you will leave the Serengeti plains and drive towards the Ngorongoro Crater.
</strong></div><div><strong>After a picnic lunch at a designated picnic spot, you will travel in the direction of the Ngorongoro Crater. As soon as you reach the crater’s edge, you will see the giant Ngorongoro Crater where this caldera opens before you in all its glory.
</strong></div><div><strong>We cross the conservation area and head to our next safari lodge near Karatu. We overnight at a Ngorongoro Farmhouse (or similar), located on a sprawling estate about 30 minutes from the entrance gate of the Ngorongoro Crater Conservation Area. The farmhouse is set on a coffee plantation, offering lovely views over the lush crater highlands. In the afternoon we set off on a coffee walk to find out more about coffee and how it is cultivated and processed.

</strong></div><div><strong>Meals- Breakfast; Lunch; Dinner
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 6: Ngorongoro Crater &amp; Karatu (Tanzania)
</strong></div><div><strong>After breakfast at the safari lodge we make our way back to the Ngorongoro Crater Park and descend the steep crater walls to explore this diverse wilderness area, teeming with Africa's wildlife.
</strong></div><div><strong>Ngorongoro, part of the Serengeti ecosystem, is a massive caldera spanning an impressive 18 km in diameter with walls as high as 600m. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is home to the densest mammalian population in Africa, at around 25,000 large animals.
</strong></div><div><strong>The Crater hosts the Big Five of Africa (lion, leopard, rhino, elephant and buffalo), boasting one of the highest concentration of lions in the world. The Ngorongoro Crater not only hosts the Big Five of Africa, but also almost all of the wild animal species found on the savannahs of East Africa. Ngorongoro offers first-class game viewing and is considered one of the best places to capture the endangered black rhino on film. The diverse habitats found on the fertile crater floor support a variety of wildlife, including elephants, monkeys, hyena, jackal and herds of zebra, wildebeest, buffalo and other antelope species.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>We stop for a picnic lunch in the crater and after our thrilling wildlife experience we depart from the Ngorongoro Crater Conservation Area returning to our overnight lodge near Karatu.
</strong></div><div><strong>We spend another night at the colonial-style Ngorongoro Farm House, a unique Tanzanian Lodge experience that takes guests back in time. This exclusive, yet earthy, lodge looks onto the dormant Oldeani Volcano and features a swimming pool, internet and dining areas.
</strong></div><div><strong>
