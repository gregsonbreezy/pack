</strong></div><div><strong>This unforgettable Africa safari packages will take you to the Lake Manyara National Park, one of Tanzania’s most dramatically located wildlife areas, consisting of a shallow but huge soda lake, located at the foot of the Great Rift Valley’s western escarpment. The size of the park makes it perfect for a one-day game drive and is notably famous for it’s tree-climbing lions. This safari will also take you to the Serengeti National Park, a massive wilderness of 14500 square km, where every day brings a new landscape and a new adventure. It will also take you to the Ngorongoro Crater and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area in Tanzania, featuring one of the highest concentrations of game and arguably the densest population of predators and carnivores in Africa.

Finally, your safari will also take you to the Tarangire National Park, which once again features some of the greatest concentration of game in Tanzania – second only to the Ngorongoro Crater – but less crowded and unspoiled – possessing a wild and unkempt beauty.

</strong></div><div><strong>ITINERARY FOR THIS TOUR
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 1 – Arusha – Lake Manyara
</strong></div><div><strong>Distance: 130 km
</strong></div><div><strong>Pick up from Arusha and transfer to Lake Manyara National Park. We arrive in time for lunch at the lodge and after lunch we head into the Lake Manyara National Park for an afternoon game drive. This national park is one of Tanzania’s most dramatically located wildlife areas, consisting of a massive but shallow soda lake (covering two-thirds of the park), located at the foot of the Great Rift Valley’s western escarpment. The park’s varied habitat attracts a wide variety of animals, including one of Africa’s largest concentrations of elephants, Lake Manyara’s unique tree-climbing lions (rare), as well as large flocks of flamingos attracted by the algae in the lake.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Dinner and overnight as per the standard and type of accommodation option requested.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 2 – Lake Manyara National Park – Serengeti Plai
</strong></div><div><strong>Distance: 205 km
</strong></div><div><strong>After breakfast we head towards the Serengeti National Park, via the beautiful high lying farmland of Karatu and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Leaving the highlands behind, we descend into the heart of wild Africa – the Serengeti National Park – with its endless plains, rolling into the distance as far as the eye can see. We head to the central park area, known as the Seronera area, one of the richest wildlife habitats in the park, featuring the Seronera River, which provides a valuable water source to this area and therefore attracts wildlife well representative of most of the Serengeti’s species. We arrive in time for lunch and enjoy an afternoon game drive in the Serengeti National Park.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Dinner and overnight in the Seronera area, as per the standard and type of accommodation option requested.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 3 – Serengeti Plains
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Be one of only a few fortunate people to glide in a Hot Air Balloon over the Serengeti Plains (available at supplementary cost by pre-arrangement). Floating silently above the awakening bush, while spotting wildlife and enjoying the amazing scenery of Africa, across rivers and over numerous small villages.
</strong></div><div><strong>We do an after breakfast full day game drive with lunch at the lodge. We will follow the Kopjes Circuit, which goes anti-clockwise around the Maasai Kopjes, which usually attract a number of lion and some formidably large cobras. Kopjes are weathered granite outcrops, scattered around the plains, most of which are miniature ecosystems, providing shade and drinking water in pools left in the rock after the rains. This makes the kopjes particularly good for spotting wildlife in the dry seasons – including lions, which like to lie in wait for animals coming to drink!
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Dinner and overnight in the Seronera area, as per the standard and type of accommodation option requested.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 4 – Serengeti Plains
</strong></div><div><strong>After breakfast we enjoy a full day game drive with lunch at the lodge, along the Sogore River Circuit, which loops into the plains south of the Seronera River, and which is good for possible lion, Thomson gazelle, topi, ostrich and cheetah sightings. The visitor’s centre not far from the Serengeti Seronera Lodge and public campsites, is well worth a visit after the morning’s game drive. This nicely designed centre, offers some interesting wildlife displays as well as a gift shop selling information leaflets and maps of the area. The centre also has a shop where cold drinks and snacks can be purchased, as well as a picnic area and information trail up and around a nearby kopje. We will enjoy a relaxed picnic lunch at the centre in the shade of the giant acacia trees.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Dinner and overnight in the Seronera area, as per the standard and type of accommodation option requested.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 5 – Serengeti Plains – Ngorongoro Crater
</strong></div><div><strong>Distance: 145 km
</strong></div><div><strong>After breakfast at the lodge do we depart to Ngorongoro Conservation area. We will stopover at Olduvai Gorge, boasting with a history dating back to the dawn of time. It was here, that the anthropologists Drs. Lois and Mary Leakey discovered the skulls of the’Nutcracker Man’ and ‘Handy Man’, both very significant links in the chain of human evolution.
</strong></div><div><strong>We arrive in time for lunch at the lodge and spend the afternoon at leisure.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Dinner and overnight as per the standard and type of accommodation option requested on the crater rim, no accommodation available inside the crater.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Day 6 – Ngorongoro Crater
</strong></div><div><strong>After breakfast we descend 600m into this magnificent crater for a full-day game drive. The Ngorongoro Crater is one of the most densely crowded African wildlife areas in the world and is home to an estimated 30,000 animals including some of Tanzania’s last remaining black rhino. Supported by a year round water supply and fodder, the Ngorongoro National Park supports a vast variety of animals, which include herds of wildebeest, zebra, buffalo, eland, warthog, hippo, and giant African elephants. Another big draw card to this picturesque national park is its huge population of predators, which include lions, hyenas, jackals, cheetahs and the ever-elusive leopard. We will enjoy a picnic lunch on the crater floor.

</strong></div><div><strong>Distance: 155 km
</strong></div><div><strong>After breakfast we depart for the Tarangire National Park. The park runs along the line of the Tarangire River and is mainly made up of low-lying hills on the Great Rift Valley floor. Its natural vegetation mainly consists of Acacia woodland and giant African Baobab trees, with huge swamp areas in the south. Both the river and the swamps act like a magnet for wild animals, during Tanzania’s dry season. The Tarangire National Park is reputed to contain some of the largest elephant herds in Africa. This African National Park is also home to three rare species of animals – the Greater Kudu, the Fringed-eared Oryx, as well as a few Ashy Starlings.
